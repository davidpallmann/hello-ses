# Hello, SES!

This is the code project for the [Hello, SES!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-ses) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Simple Email Service. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon SES and use it to send mail from a .NET program. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, SES Project

We will write a .NET console program that sends mail via SES, using the Amazon SDK for .NET.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
